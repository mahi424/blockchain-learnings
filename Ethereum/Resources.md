Links to Original Bitcoin & Ethereum White Papers
These the links to the original Bitcoin and Ethereum White Papers.
Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System (https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf). This was published by the anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto on October 31, 2008.

Ethereum: The Ultimate Smart Contract and Decentralized Application Platform (http://web.archive.org/web/20131228111141/http://vbuterin.com/ethereum.html). This was originally published by Vitalik Buterin at the end of 2013. 

There is also an Ethereum Yellow Paper that describes the protocol's technical specifications.

There is also an interesting  NSA document from 1996 that describes a system similar to Bitcoin: HOW TO MAKE A MINT: THE CRYPTOGRAPHY OF ANONYMOUS ELECTRONIC CASH
